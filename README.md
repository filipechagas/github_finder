Pet project to test out some javascript functionalities (more at https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)

To see it in action, copy githubcreds.js.sample to githubcreds.js and fill in with your api creds. 

Oh, you don't have one?

1. In the upper-right corner of any Github page, click your profile photo, then click Settings. 

2. In the left sidebar, click Developer settings. 

3. In the left sidebar, click OAuth Apps. 


You should know what to do from there.
